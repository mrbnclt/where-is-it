# Where to watch?

Have you ever wanted to watch a movie and search through Netflix only to find out it's not available in the platform, then search once again in Disney+, and again on HBO, and so forth on multiple streaming platforms. This project is a Chrome extension that allows a minimal search of movies / tv shows available to your region and show you which platform you can watch the show.

# Features:
- Search for movies / tv shows.
- Shows what streaming providers where a movie / tv show is available in your region.
- [_IN PROGRESS_] Ability to change region (useful if you have a VPN)
